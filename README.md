# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
It has gained a lot of popularity in the past few years and researchers at some of the world's best universities and companies are working tirelessly to move towards a more generalised AI.

Andrew Ng has described deep learning as
"Using brain simulations, we hope to:

– Make learning algorithms much better and easier to use.

– Make revolutionary advances in machine learning and AI.

I believe this is our best shot at progress towards real AI"

This repository is my attempt to get hands on experience with existing deep learning libraries.
This will contain the deep learning problems I have tried working on with the help of different resources.

While I'm no artificial intelligence wizard (I do wish to be one in the future), I am trying to understand the concepts of machine learning and deep learning and my knowledge is gradually increasing (that's what I think).

I believe one has to get their hands dirty in the actual code to understand the whole topic better, and thus, I will keep uploading codes as I try to understand the math behind these amazing algorithms.
